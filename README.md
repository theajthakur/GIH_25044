# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization

## 📌 Problem Statement

Small-scale farmers often struggle with unpredictable crop yields due to weather changes, soil conditions, and lack of timely agricultural insights.  
Our solution is an **AI-powered platform** that predicts crop yields and provides **actionable recommendations** for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, tailored to specific crops and regional conditions.

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

- Increase farmer productivity by **at least 10%** through data-driven insights.
- Provide an accessible web/mobile app with **regional language support**.
- Deliver actionable and **easy-to-understand recommendations**.
- Scalable platform with potential to integrate satellite and IoT data.
